        <h1>One Day Projects</h1>
        <small>These are quick and cheerful projects which I have made, just for practice really. The idea being they are fully functional within the day, or a couple of hours.</small>
        <ul>
            <li><a href='./minesweeper/'>minesweeper</a> </li>
            <p>Made as a React.js mini project. It was just because minesweeper seemed to lend itself to react, with multiple similar components.</p>
        </ul>
